# The Fibonacci Sequence
This is recursive implementation of Fibonacci sequence in Ruby, assigned by [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/recursion).

The Fibonacci sequence begins with `F(0) = 0` and `F(1) = 1` as its respective first and second terms. After these first two elements, each subsequent element is equal to the sum of the previous two elements: `F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2)`. For more information see its [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number).
